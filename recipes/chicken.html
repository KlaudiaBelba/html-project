    <h3>Description</h3>


    <p>Whether you keep them on hand for quick lunches or serve them for dinner tonight,<br> a juicy Grilled Chicken Breast is the perfect way to upgrade any meal.</p>
    <p>Mastering the art of preparing a perfectly grilled chicken breast will make you feel like <br>a has-her-life-together grown-up. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts about 3 medium breasts</li>
        <li>1 batch best Chicken Marinade*</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh herbs crumbled feta cheese, a squeeze of lemon juice, optional for serving</li>
        <li>Oil for grilling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board (leave several inches between them and work in batches as needed).<br> Cover with plastic wrap to keep things tidy, and with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or your fist, pound the chicken to an even thickness. <br> It doesn't need to be ultra thinâ€”just make sure the middle is fairly even with the ends (the chicken should be about 1/2-inch thick).</li>
    <br> <li>With a fork, poke holes all over the chicken (this will allow the marinade to absorb).</li>
    <br> <li>In a large ziptop bag, combine the marinade ingredients, then add the chicken.</li>
    <br><li>Meat and marinade in a plastic bag
        Seal the bag to evenly coat the chicken with the marinade.<br> Place in a pan or bowl to catch any drips. Let the chicken marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, <br>or refrigerate it to marinate for up to 12 hours (5 to 6 hours is ideal). Even 15 minutes is better than nothing!</li>
        <br><li>When ready to grill, preheat the grill to high (475 degrees F). If your chicken has been in the refrigerator, <br>remove it and allow it to come to room temperature for at least 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grates.</li>
        <br><li>Place the chicken on the grill presentation (smooth) side down, shaking off any excess marinade. <br>Cover the grill and let cook for 4 to 5 minutes on the first side, then flip. The chicken should lift easily off the grill; <br> if it sticks, allow it to cook another minute or two.
        Three chicken breasts on the grill</li>
        <br><li>Recover the grill and cook for an additional 4 to 8 minutes. Chicken is considered done at 165 degrees F. <br>I like to remove chicken from the grill around the 155-160 degree F mark and allow it to finish cooking while resting.<br> DO NOT OVERCOOK, or your chicken will be dry.</li>
        <br><li>Place the chicken on a plate and let rest for at least 5 minutes (resting is mandatory!). <br>Add any desired toppings or sauces. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
